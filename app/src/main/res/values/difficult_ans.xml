        <item> Android does not use the traditional Java Virtual Machine. Instead, it uses Dalvik Virtual Machine that uses a special
            bytecode. That is why we cannot execute standard Java programs on an Android device. DVM is optimized for mobile devices.
            It optimizes the virtual machine for memory, performance and battery life. The applications that can run on Android are
            .apk files. It is a unique compiled code that stands for Android Package.
            You can develop your code in Java. But you need to change the .jar files to .apk files before you can run your program
            in Android. The android tool called dx tool or the Dex compiler converts the Java class files into .dex files that can run
            on DVM. Android Assets Packaging Tool converts the .dex files in .apk files. </item>
        <item> A nine patch image is a stretchable bitmap image that can be used as a background of a view. Android automatically resizes
            the image to accommodate the content of the view. The nine patch image helps android in its goal to support a variety of
            different screen sizes. The main difference between a regular .png and nine patch image is that the latter includes an extra
            1-pixel border around the image that determines where the image can be stretched to meet the specific layout constraints. The
            image can be divided into 9 sections. The 4 corners are static, the 4 edges are scaled in 1 axis and the center one can be
            scaled in both the axis. The extension of the nine patch images is .9.png. </item>
